# Algorithm Debt Research

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks developed in Google Colab for researching **Algorithm Debt (AD)** in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) systems. The primary aim is to classify and identify AD within ML/DL source code using various ML/DL models and embeddings.
